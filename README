Planets

A turn-based Space eXplore/eXpand/eXterminate game

The game consists of two major parts - a hosting system, written with ruby/sinatra/redis, that manages
the universe, runs the daily turns, deals with authentication of clients, and so on, and one or more client
programs that display the data from the host system, and allow the entry of commands. 

The protocol used is such that it should be fairly easy to write a client in nearly any language that's capable
of supporting a https POST.

Requirements for host: ruby, bundler, sinatra, redis. 

Install: download the repo, do "bundler install".

Run: do "ruby web" to run the webserver. "ruby master" to create a new universe, "ruby host" to run the turn.

Planets

A turn-based Space eXplore/eXpand/eXterminate game

The game consists of two major parts - a hosting system, written with ruby/sinatra/redis, that manages
the universe, runs the daily turns, deals with authentication of clients, and so on, and one or more client
programs that display the data from the host system, and allow the entry of commands. 

The protocol used is such that it should be fairly easy to write a client in nearly any language that's capable
of supporting a https POST.

Note the intent is to do the combat engine in Lua, so it can use the same code on the client and server. 

Requirements for host: Lua, anything that can do a cgi script (developed under apache), redis

Run: do "lua web" to run the webserver. "lua master" to create a new universe, "lua host" to run the turn.
